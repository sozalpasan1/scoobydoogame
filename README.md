# scoobydoogame

## Whats up guys

I'm using PlayCanvas for this project. This is the most goated library for 3d Games

## Before you begin, go to playcanvas.com and make an account!!!

Now, I want you to go to my repository, and go to the repo called
### scoobydoogame

Fork, then clone the repo.


# IT IS HIHGLY IMPORTANT YOU FOLLOW THESE NEXT STEPS CAREFULLY


Youll notice that in the repo, there is a .zip file.

This .zip file (called ScoobyDooInitGame.zip) is the entire game.

Go to https://playcanvas.com, make an account, go to your profile, and there should be a tab called, "Projects" --> Click on it

On the left-hand side, there should be a button that says "Import Project"

Click on this, then select the zip file.

The importing process will now begin.

## NOW THAT IMPORTING IS DONE, YOU WILL BE TAKEN TO THE PROJECT PAGE

# go to the settings tab, and change where it says "Scooby Doo" TO "YOURNAME_scoobydoo"

# THEN CLICK SAVE AT THE BOTTOM

## please make sure the name at the top of the screen properly updates

### Now you can click on the orange "EDITOR" button
That opens the editor

Now in the editor start making the actual game

# WHEN MAKING THE GAME, roughly follow the MVP

## PlayCanvas is pretty goated, so there are some things you can kind of skip in terms of actually building the game.

### General functionality and flow of the game should remain the same, the process of getting there is a bit more flexible

For testing you can click the "Launch" button in the top right corner of the viewing area

# YOURE DONE? OK COOL

After you're done in the editor, you can just close the tab. 
PlayCanvas saves everything automatically

Now that you're done editing for the day, it's time to commit this puppy.

# THIS PART A LIL COMPLEX, SO PAY ATTENTION

Look at your MAIN projects page, the one you get to from clicking on your pfp in the top right.

There should be a thumbnail (not accurate of what the acc project looks like)

There should be the name of the project

The date it was created

the access of the files, and your permissions

To the right of all this, you will see your user Icon, and a small down arrow.

## Hover over this down arrow, and click export project

This will download the zip to your computer.

# RENAME THIS ZIP TO YOUR NAME & THE DATE + TIME YOU DOWNLOADED THE FILE

Then simply add this new file to the root level of the repository.

## DO NOT ADD ANYTHING INTO ./public

Because you will only be changing the game, no changes need to be made in regards to the actual "web development" part

Then you can commit whatever you made for the day.
